2) Explain the purpose of comments in HTML an provide an example of how to use comments in an html document?
Ans - Comment tags in HTML are used to provide non-visible information or explanations within the code. 
         Comments are ignored by web browsers when rendering a web page, so they are not displayed.
         HTML comments are enclosed within <!-- and --> tags. Anything between these tags is considered a comment and is not rendered by the browser.
 Ex:- <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html lang="en">
         <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Document</title>
         </head>
         <body>
                 <!-- This all are HTML heading tag used to mark up a webpage -->
                 <h1>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Illum, ut!</h1>
                 <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Provident, eligendi.</h2>
                 <h3>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sunt, aliquid.</h3>
                 <h4>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aliquam, ea!</h4>
                 <h5>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Tempora, iusto?</h5>
                 <h6>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Optio, dolore.</h6>
         </body>
         </html>

4) Write a short note on Tag and element with an example?
Ans - An HTML tag is a set of characters enclosed in angle brackets (<>). 
         Tags are used to define various elements and components on a web page.
  Ex:- <p> , <h1>, <h2>, <br>
         An HTML element consists of an opening tag and a closing tag. 
         Elements are used to structure and define the content on a web page.
         The opening tag contains the name of the element and may include attributes that provide additional information or properties to the element.
         The closing tag is the same as the opening tag but with a forward slash before the element name.

5) What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?
Ans - The DOCTYPE declaration, commonly referred to as the "DOCTYPE," is an important declaration at the very beginning of an HTML document. 
          Its primary purpose is to specify the type of document and HTML version in which the document is written. 
          The DOCTYPE declaration instructs web browsers and other applications on how to appropriately interpret and produce HTML content.
